# 📄💼 Resume Classification using Machine Learning

## 📝 Description
This is a Python-based machine learning project that classifies resumes into predefined job categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

A smart and automated way to sort resumes into categories like Data Science, Web Development, and more! The project features an interactive Jupyter Notebook and is fully containerized using Docker 🐳.

## ✨ Features
🚀 Text Preprocessing – Tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF vectorization
🧠 ML Models – Train classifiers like Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.
📊 Evaluation – View metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix
🔁 Modular Design – Easily add new categories or models
📦 Dockerized – Run it anywhere with one command
